This is a website used to buy domains. This website is fully responsive and is made mostly in HTML5 and CSS3.
In the header of this web page, a menu strip has been created and with the help of media query it
is responsive, that is, when the customer is on the phone, he only has the menu strip, and when he 
is on the computer,he has a different version of the menu because it is a responsive page.
On this page you can see 3 different domains as well as their advantages and which domain is the most popular. 
On this website, it is possible to see what the increase in domain purchases actually looks like, how quickly it is possible to create a website and how wordpress helps us in this (of course, everything is lorem ipsum text, that's just an example).
It has an example of what it should look like as a customer's response as well as his picture and who he is, i.e. his name (again, an example of lorem ipsum). 
Finally, in the footer, something like a link on the next response page was created.
